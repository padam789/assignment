               2024 in seven phases, to elect all <b>543 members </b> of the Lok <br>    
               Sabha.[b] Votes were counted and the result was declared <br>     
               on <b> 4 June  </b> form the 18th Lok Sabha<br></p>
         
               
         <p>  More than 968 million people out of a population of 1.4 <br>
              billion people were eligible to vote, equivalent to 70% of the <br>
              total population.[4][5][6] 642 million voters participated in the <br>
              election and 312 million of them were women, making it the<br>
              highest ever participation by women voters.[7][8] The<br>
               legislative assembly elections in the states of Andhra <br>
               Pradesh, Arunachal Pradesh, Odisha, and Sikkim were held<br>
                simultaneously with the general election, along with the by-<br>
                elections for 25 constituencies in 12 legislative assemblies.<br></p>

         <p> This was the largest-ever<a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/6/3/india-election-results-winners-and-losers-of-all-past-lok-sabha-votes"> election in history,</a> surpassing the<br>
               previous election, and lasted 44 days, second only to the<br>
               <b> 1951–52 Indian general election. </b> prime minister <br>
                Narendra Modi, who completed a second term, ran for a<br>
                 third consecutive term. The election was criticised for lack of<br>
                  action on hate speeches by Modi's Bharatiya Janata Party<br>
                   (BJP),[9] reported<u> Electronic Voting Machine (EVM) </u><br>
                   malfunctioning,[10][11] and alleged suppression of political <br>
                   opponents of the BJP.[12]        <br> </p>


         <p> Although Modi's coalition, the National Democratic Alliance<br>
               (NDA), <u> secured 293 of 543 seats in the Lok Sabha,[13]</u> the <br>
              <b> BJP lost its majority </b> the opposition secured more seats<br>
                than initially projected. The opposition coalition Indian <br>
                National Developmental Inclusive Alliance (INDIA) secured<br>
                 234 seats, with the Indian National Congress winning the <br>
                 most with <b>99 seats.</b>[14][15][16] By 5 June, Modi would secure<br>
                  the backing he needed from his coalition allies for a third<br>
                   term.[17] <br></p>

      <p><b>Contemporary politics and previous elections</b></p> 
      
      <p>ndia has a multi-party system with two major parties,<br>
          namely the<b> Bharatiya Janata Party and the Indian National</b><br>
           Congress, that dominate politics at the national level. The<br>
            Bharatiya Janata Party has governed the country with<br>
            <u> Narendra Modi at the helm since 2014. </u> tenure of the<br>
              17th Lok Sabha is scheduled to end on 16 June 2024.[18] <br>
              The previous general election was held in April–May 2019,<br>
               after which the National Democratic Alliance, led by the <br>
               Bharatiya Janata Party, formed the union government, with<br>
                Modi continuing as Prime Minister.[19] The Indian National<br>
                 Developmental Inclusive Alliance, comprising of 26 <br>
                 opposition parties, was formed in 2023 to contest the BJP in<br> 
                 the 2024 Lok Sabha elections.[20]<br></p>

         the Lok Sabha to be held once every five years.[21] All 543 <br>
         elected MPs are elected from single-member constituencies<br>
          using first-past-the-post voting.[22] The 104th amendment to the <br>
          constitution abolished the two seats that were reserved for the<br>
           Anglo-Indian community.[23]<br></p>

    <p> Eligible voters must be Indian citizens, 18 years or older,<br> 
          ordinary residents of the polling area of the constituency<br> 
           and registered to vote (name included in the electoral rolls),<br> 
            possess a valid voter identification card issued by the <br> 
            Election Commission of India or equivalent.[24] Some people<br> 
             convicted of electoral or other offenses are barred from voting.[25]<br> 
              Indians holding foreign citizenship are also barred from voting.<br> 
               There is no postal or online absentee voting in India; members of <br> 
               the Indian diaspora are required to travel back to their home<br> 
                constituencies in order to cast a ballot.[26]     <br> </p>
